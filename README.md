# tensorflow-image-classifier(Inception)

A generic image classifier program using Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) and the pre-trained Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network model called Inception (https://research.googleblog.com/2016/03/train-your-own-image-classifier-with.html).

This model has been pre-trained for the  ImageNet (http://image-net.org/) data, it can differentiate between 1,000 different classes
The program applies Transfer Learning to this existing model and re-trains it to classify a new set of images.

This is a generic setup and can be used to classify almost any kind of image. 

# Webcam Face finder and Indentifier(OpenCV + Tensorflow)

This also finds faces in the webcam video input and tries to recognize me (Rahul or you, if trained) if doesnt find me in the face then classifies the face as Male or Female or Nishita.  This can be retrained with your own training data.
 
## Installation
Make sure you have Python (https://www.python.org/) installed, then install Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and  openCV3(https://opencv.org/opencv-3-0.html) on your system and clone this repo.
